description: How to write LLM rules
globs:
alwaysApply: true
---

Rule files have to be of `mdc` format with the following preamble:
```
---
description: 
globs:
alwaysApply: true
---
```

Where:
- `description` is a short informative summary of when this rule is applicable
- `glob` comma separated globs for when the rule should be auto attached into the context given that an LLM is operating on a file that matches the glob
- `alwaysApply` if this is true, globs are disregarded and the rule is automatically added to the LLMs context

The content of the rule is a source of truth for an LLM. Do not put conversation points in the rule files.
